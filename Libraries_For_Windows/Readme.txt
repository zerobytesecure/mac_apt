** THESE ARE NO LONGER PUBLISHED SINCE v1.5.7 AS THE RECOMMENDED
   METHOD IS INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES VIA PIP FROM THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT 
   FILE. SEE THE WIKI LINK BELOW FOR ISSUES INSTALLING VIA PIP:
   https://github.com/ydkhatri/mac_apt/wiki/Installation-for-Python3 **   

You will need to copy the .pyd files contained here into your python 
installation folder under Lib\site-packages\

This is specific for Python version (3.7/3.8) and will not work with 
other versions. It is also specific to your platform (32/64 bits). 
Python 3.9 onwards, only the 64 bit library will be available.

The 32-bit versions are located in the 32bit_ folder. 
The 64-bit versions are located in the 64bit_ folder. 

Copy only the files for your platform any python version into 
Lib\site-packages\

If you are unsure about your python version and platform (32/64), then
run python.exe, note version, then run the following 2 lines of code:

 import sys
 sys.maxsize > 2**32

If the reply is True, you are on 64 bit python, else 32 bit.

The .pyd files are DLLs that have been compiled using Visual Studio 2017
or 2019. These files are dependencies that need to be installed for 
mac_apt to run on Windows (when running from code).
