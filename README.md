mac_apt is a DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) tool to process Mac computer full disk images (**or _live_ machines**) and extract data/metadata useful for forensic investigation. It is a python based framework, which has plugins to process individual artifacts (such as Safari internet history, Network interfaces, Recently accessed files & volumes, ..)

mac_apt now also includes **[ios_apt](https://swiftforensics.com/2020/12/introducing-iosapt-ios-artifact-parsing.html)**, for processing ios images.
